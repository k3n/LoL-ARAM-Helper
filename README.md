LoL-ARAM-Helper
===============

Helper app for the game League of Legends, specifically the All-Random-All-Mid game type.

The goal is to help you quickly reference info about champions and items on the occassion that you end up with a champion that you may not be too familiar with. There is a focus on guides since runes, masteries and skill level order are what I find to be the most useful, though sometimes further information such as ability/damage ratios and item info can also be useful.
